          <p>Swiss Monkey is a job matching service to facilitate connections between employers/professional offices
            (“Offices”) seeking to fill open permanent or temporary positions (each, an "Assignment") to individuals
            with a professional degree or professional background, including without limitation dentists, doctors,
            dental assistants, physician assistants, medical secretaries and other, similarly qualified individuals
            ("Professionals"), as specified by Swiss Monkey from time to time. Professionals make available their
            professional skills to fulfill Assignment requests in exchange for compensation determined between
            Professionals and Offices, as discussed in more detail below. Offices and Professionals together are
            collectively referred to as "Users" and each individually as a "User." You are agreeing to these Terms of
            Service as either an Office or a Professional and, in either case, as a User.<br/>
            Swiss Monkey provides information about available offices and professionals to help Offices select
            Professionals connect based on criteria and needs important to each of them. It is solely the responsibility
            and ability of the Office and Professional to decide whether to offer or accept an assignment or position.
            Swiss Monkey is a marketplace for Offices and Professionals to connect. Swiss Monkey does not employ or
            retain Professionals and Swiss Monkey does not provide professional services to Offices other than the
            marketplace Services set forth herein and does not guarantee the availability or of users. The Office is the
            party that contracts with the Professional to complete an Assignment. Swiss Monkey has no liability to any
            User with regard to the quality of the Professionals or whether any Office offers suitable Assignments for
            any Professional.<br/>

            any and all of the User Information or other information listed in Your Profile (collectively, "Your

            Policy, please do not use the Website or our Services. Upon termination of Your Login Credentials for any
            reason, you may no longer have access to any of Your Information that you provided to the Website.</p>
          <p><strong>d. Background Checks</strong>
            If you are a Professional, Swiss Monkey has the right, but not the obligation, to verify whether the
            information displayed in Your Profile is accurate. If You are a Professional, You hereby grant to Swiss
            Monkey the right to conduct background checks on behalf of any Offices with which you may obtain Assignments
            through Swiss Monkey to confirm the accuracy of any User Information that is available on Your Profile
            including without limitation Your name and address, e-mail address, telephone number, photographs,
            geographical location, billing information, Your degree-granting program(s) and year(s) of graduation, any
            Assignment experience, any other of Your qualifications, Your credit score and a criminal background check
            of You (collectively, "Background Checks"). PROFESSIONAL HEREBY GRANTS TO Swiss Monkey THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT
            A CREDIT CHECK AND A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK BY REGISTERING WITH THE WEBSITE UPON RECEIVING YOUR EXPLICIT
            WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC CONSENT. PROFESSIONAL AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT Swiss Monkey RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
            DISTRIBUTE RESULTING INFORMATION, AS SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH, TO INTERESTED OFFICES POTENTIALLY SEEKING
            ASSIGNMENTS FROM YOU. For the avoidance of doubt, Swiss Monkey is under no obligation to conduct Background
            Checks on Professional, but Swiss Monkey may conduct a Background Check when a Professional first registers
            with Swiss Monkey or from time to time thereafter as long as such Professional maintains an account with
            Swiss Monkey.</p>
          <p><strong>e. Usage by Minors</strong>
            Swiss Monkey's Services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and
            older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Individuals under the age of 18 can use
            its Services only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. In such a
            case, the adult is the User and is responsible for any and all activities of the minor.</p>
          <p><strong>f. Non-Performance or Incomplete Performance of Assignments</strong>
            In the event that a Professional does not perform an Assignment at all or does not perform an Assignment in
            its entirety and in either case has not provided sufficient advance notice of such non-performance or
            incomplete performance as agreed to by such Professional and the affected Office or reasonable notice in the
            absence of such an agreement, the affected Office may notify Swiss Monkey. Swiss Monkey shall include
            information on such non-performance or incomplete performance of Assignments in Ratings for Professionals.
            Swiss Monkey reserves the right to institute other sanctions from time to time, and may, in Swiss Monkey's
            sole discretion, terminate the account of any Professional that repeatedly does not perform Assignments or
            does not completely perform Assignments that such Professional has agreed to perform without providing
            sufficient advance notice. For the avoidance of doubt, any information on non-performance or incomplete
            performance of Assignment in Ratings for Professionals shall be construed as an evaluation of such
            Professional by the relevant Office and not by Swiss Monkey.</p>
          <p>In the event that an Office cancels an Assignment and has not provided sufficient advance notice as agreed
            to by such Office and the affected Professional(s) or reasonable notice in the absence of such an agreement,
            the affected Professional(s) may notify Swiss Monkey. Swiss Monkey shall include information on such
            cancellation of Assignments in its Ratings for Offices. Swiss Monkey reserves the right to institute other
            sanctions from time to time, and may, in Swiss Monkey's sole discretion, terminate the account of any Office
            that repeatedly cancels Assignments that such Office has requested without providing sufficient advance
            notice.</p>

          <p>5. SALES. You authorize us to charge your account for Swiss Monkey fees ($49.00/posting). Other contracts
            such as sponsorship/partner fees may be billed separately upon a signed contract with User. Unless noted,

            posts we remove. We may refuse purchases, which may place a hold on your account. Visa, MasterCard, and
            American Express are accepted. </p>
          <p>6. Swiss Monkey.com is Only a Marketplace for Offices and Professionals
            Swiss Monkey is a dental job and communications platform to facilitate connections between Offices seeking
            Professionals for the completion of permanent and temporary assignments. Swiss Monkey will use good faith
            efforts to help connect Offices to Professionals based on the nature of the Assignment, criteria and
            qualifications of the Office and Professional as well as geographic proximity to the Assignment. Swiss
            Monkey disclaims any responsibility for selecting particular Professionals to perform Assignments and Office
            understands and agrees that the decision to use any Professional or no Professional is solely Office's.
            Swiss Monkey disclaims all responsibility for the accuracy of any information listed in a Professional's
            Profile, for any information or material circumstances, and for any Profile information upon which Swiss
            Monkey may rely in connecting Offices to Professionals. Office agrees and acknowledges that Office has no
            obligation to choose Professionals to perform Assignments, and that Office's decision to contract with a
            Professional is solely at Office's own risk.</p>
          <p>Swiss Monkey does not take part in the interaction between Offices and Professionals. Swiss Monkey does not
            have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any
            Assignments delivered by Professionals, nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or
            omissions whatsoever of any Users. Swiss Monkey makes no representations about the suitability, reliability,
            timeliness, or accuracy of the Assignments requested and provided by Users identified through Swiss Monkey
            whether in public, private or offline interactions. Swiss Monkey cannot confirm that Users are who they
            claim to be. Swiss Monkey does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this
            information or any information exchanged between Users through Swiss Monkey.</p>
          <p>WHILE SWISS MONKEY USES GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO CONFIRM THAT EACH PROFESSIONAL ON SWISS MONKEY'S WEBSITE IS A
            LEGITIMATE PROFESSIONAL WITH THE QUALIFICATIONS SPECIFIED BY SUCH PROFESSIONAL AND THAT EACH OFFICE HAS A
            GENUINE NEED FOR THE ASSIGNMENTS SUCH OFFICE REQUESTS, SWISS MONKEY IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES

            a private, secret or confidential nature concerning the Office's business or financial affairs
            (collectively, "Proprietary Information") is and shall be the exclusive property of such Office. By way of

            records and You will not disclose any Proprietary Information to any person or entity other than the
            applicable Office or use the same for any purposes (other than in the performance of Your duties as
            stipulated in the Assignment) without written approval by an officer of such Office, unless and until such
            Proprietary Information has become public knowledge without Your fault. While fulfilling the obligations of
            an Assignment for the Office, a Professional will use his/her best efforts to prevent unauthorized
            publication or disclosure of any of the Office's Proprietary Information. Professional agrees that all
            files, documents, letters, memoranda, reports, records, data, sketches, drawings, models, program listings,
            computer equipment or devices, computer programs or other written, photographic, or other tangible or
            intangible material containing Proprietary Information, whether created by such Professional or others,
            which shall come into his/her custody or possession, shall be and are the exclusive property of Office to be
            used by Professional only in the performance of his/her duties for the Office and shall not be copied or
            removed from Office's premises except in the pursuit of the business of Office as required to perform an
            Assignment.
            Professional agrees that the only communication with the Office's customers or patients is to schedule and
            confirm appointments (if requested in the Assignment) and to perform the Assignment. Professionals are
            prohibited from directly or indirectly contacting such customers or patients after the completion of the
            Assignment and shall not circumvent the Office or Swiss Monkey in any way. For example, Professionals may
            not provide business cards, flyers, website addresses or other contact information to any customer or
            patient of Office.
            Swiss Monkey may require you to agree to an additional non-disclosure agreement prior to sharing certain
            other information with you. Any such non-disclosure agreement between you and Swiss Monkey shall apply to
            information shared in connection with the Website or Services, unless otherwise provided in such
            non-disclosure agreement.

          <h3>20. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
          <p>Except if You opt-out or for disputes relating to Your or Swiss Monkey's intellectual property (such as
            trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); You agree that all disputes
            between You and Swiss Monkey (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of or relating
            to these Terms of Service, the Services, and/or Privacy Policy shall be finally resolved by arbitration
            before a single arbitrator conducted in the English language in Sacramento, California, U.S.A. under the
            Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and You and Swiss Monkey hereby
            expressly waive trial by jury. You and Swiss Monkey shall appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually
            agreed by You and Swiss Monkey or, if You and Swiss Monkey cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either
            party's request for arbitration, such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of
            either party. The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party
            shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in
            such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and
            binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this,
            application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Swiss Monkey shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, security or other
            equitable remedies from the United States District Court for a district in California or any other court of
            competent jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies
            or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use or to award punitive damages, including but not limited to
            pursuant to federal or state statutes permitting multiple or punitive awards. Any claims brought by you or
            Swiss Monkey must be brought in that party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in
            any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither You nor Swiss Monkey will participate in a class
            action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms of Service. You hereby waive any and
            all rights to bring any claims related to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class
            member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
            You may opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Swiss Monkey can require the
            other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Swiss Monkey in writing
            within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. The opt-out notice
            must state that You do not agree to the Agreement To Arbitrate and must include Your name, address, phone
            number, Your Swiss Monkey account to which the opt-out applies and a clear statement that You want to opt
            out of this Agreement To Arbitrate. You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. This procedure
            is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement To Arbitrate. You must use this address to opt out: Swiss
            Monkey, Inc. ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, c/o Swiss Monkey INC, 1816 L Street, Sacramento, CA 95811. This
            Arbitration section will survive the termination of your relationship with Swiss Monkey.</p>
